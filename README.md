# 🚀 Bohdan Kulinchenko

> *“Between logic and art lies code.”*

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** and **Tech Lead** who treats software as both engineering and storytelling.  
With 10+ years in code, I’ve led teams, launched startups, and built systems that stayed online long enough to matter.

---

### 🧩 What I Do
- **Architect microservice ecosystems** and design data flows that survive scale.  
- **Build products end-to-end** with TypeScript, Next.js, GelDB, and real attention to developer experience.  
- **Lead with empathy** — mentoring devs, balancing chaos, and shipping what others overthink.

Currently contributing to [HeroUI](https://github.com/heroui) and developing **EstCarGo**,  
an international marketplace where auctions meet modern UX.

### 🪶 Writing
I publish practical guides and experiments on [Medium @itboom.dev](https://medium.com/@itboom.dev) —  
from TypeScript wizardry to design systems that don’t collapse under their own beauty.

Some favorites:
- *“Tailwind 4 & the Anatomy of Design Systems”*  
- *“Typed Drizzle: safer queries, saner devs”*  
- *“HeroUI and the hidden elegance of composition”*

### 🧘‍♂️ Philosophy
- Moderate perfectionism beats burnout heroism.  
- Code is a craft, not a contest.  
- Good architecture is invisible — bad one screams at 3 AM.
